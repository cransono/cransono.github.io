      <p>– start of the round –

1) Inhale deep and exhale by letting go (shallow exhale) repeatedly at a somewhat fast pace for 2 minutes or more

2) Deep breath in and hold your breath for 15 seconds (do not push it)

3) Repeat 1 and 2

4) Exhale slowly and do the breath hold for 2 minutes or more

5) Deep breath in and hold your breath for 15 seconds (do not push it)

6) Exhale slowly and do the breath hold for 50 seconds or more

7) Deep breath in and hold your breath for 15 seconds (do not push it)

– start the next round and repeat until you are done –

Notes:

    Do NOT push the air in steps 2,5 and 7. I no longer recommend it, too forceful.
    In between the steps you can take up to 15 seconds of pause to enjoy the feeling
    Take it easy between steps 2 and 3 (pause if you need)
    If you can’t do the breath hold for the suggested duration, then do less
    Use a stopwatch/timer
