      – start of the round –<br>

1) Inhale deep and exhale by letting go (shallow exhale) repeatedly at a somewhat fast pace for 2 minutes or more<br>
<br>
2) Deep breath in and hold your breath for 15 seconds (do not push it)<br>
<br>
3) Repeat 1 and 2<br>
<br>
4) Exhale slowly and do the breath hold for 2 minutes or more<br>
<br>
5) Deep breath in and hold your breath for 15 seconds (do not push it)<br>
<br>
6) Exhale slowly and do the breath hold for 50 seconds or more<br>
<br>
7) Deep breath in and hold your breath for 15 seconds (do not push it)<br>
<br>
– start the next round and repeat until you are done –<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<br>
    Do NOT push the air in steps 2,5 and 7. I no longer recommend it, too forceful. In between the steps you can take up to 15 seconds of pause to enjoy the feeling. Take it easy between steps 2 and 3 (pause if you need). If you can’t do the breath hold for the suggested duration, then do less. Use a stopwatch/timer.<br>
